# script.service.hyperion

Kodi add-on to capture video data and send it to Hyperion. Note that this plugin will not work for Kodi running on the Raspberry Pi, because the video capture interface is not (yet?) supported on this device.

Information about Hyperion can be found here: https://wiki.hyperion-project.org

The add-on can be installed by downloading the zip and extracting it to the add-on directory (probably ~/.kodi/addons on Linux and %AppData%\Kodi\addons on Windows)
